The Breadchain Crowdstaking Application is essentially a smart contract on the Polygon network that forwards Crowdstakers’ DAI (a fully collateralized US Dollar pegged stablecoin) into a lending pool in which all of the interest earned on the DAI goes to Breadchain to help fund more projects part of the [Breadchain Network](https://breadcha.in/projects).

In return for giving DAI, Crowdstakers mint and receive a token called BREAD as collateral in the same quantity they gave in DAI. The BREAD token acts as both a form of collateral from the cooperative and a digital local currency for the Breadchain Network of projects and broader ecosystem. Digital as in crypto and local not as in geographic locality, but local in shared values around cooperativism. And like a local currency, it is intended to keep value within the defined locality. It is at the same time an engine for fundraising for post-capitalist blockchain projects as well as a digital local currency mechanism. It is the first solidarity primitive created by the Breadchain Cooperative.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

- What is Breadchain?
  - Breadchain is a collective federation of decentralized cooperative projects looking to forge solidarity through tech projects that help us build a truly cooperative, democratic economy.
- What do I need to get some BREAD?
  - You need to have the [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) browser plugin (or a wallet that can inject as Metamask), the amount of DAI to mint into BREAD, and some MATIC cryptocurrency to pay for the transaction fee for the Polygon Network.
- How do I connect to the Polygon network?
  - [Here](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/metamask/config-polygon-on-metamask/) are the instructions for doing so on Metamask.
- How do I get DAI and MATIC on the Polygon network?
  - There are several options for getting DAI and MATIC to your wallet on the Polygon network. You will need MATIC first to pay for transaction fees on Polygon. If you already have MATIC in your Polygon wallet, you can swap for DAI on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?chain=polygon) on the Polygon network. If you need MATIC, there are several options.

**Option 1** - Direct deposit to Polygon from a crypto exchange

Crypto.com, Binance, and MEXC offer direct withdraw of MATIC to the Polygon network.

**Option 2** - Transak / Moonpay

With [Transak](https://transak.com/) you can buy crypto with a debit or credit card including MATIC to send to a polygon wallet. [Moonpay](https://www.moonpay.com/buy/matic) is another option for those in the US. You may need to go through KYC.

**Option 3** - Layerswap

[Layerswap.io](http://Layerswap.io) offers for many CEXs to withdraw directly to Polygon and several other L2s but does not offer MATIC, only ETH, USDC, or LRC so the user will need MATIC already on a Polygon wallet.

**Option 4** - Polygon Bridge / Hop Protocol

The official [Polygon bridge](https://wallet.polygon.technology/bridge/) can be used by those who already have assets on the ethereum main chain but there will potentially be a significant gas cost. Another option if you have assets on other EVM chains is [Hop Protocol](https://hop.exchange/).

- Why use Polygon and not another network?
  - When we first detailed the application we had the intention of deploying it on the Ethereum main net but we realized that the gas fees were much too high to justify whereas using the app on Polygon consistently costs below $0.02 or even below $0.01 to interact with. We understand that deploying on Polygon is less decentralized than the Ethereum main net, but for the beginning we think this is the right approach. In the future we’d like to consider moving to a proper Ethereum Layer 2 solution but we are waiting to see the ecosystem mature before migrating. At the same time, Polygon usually yields a good APY as it has a thriving DeFi ecosystem for the moment.
- How does me minting BREAD, help the cooperative economy on the blockchain?
  - By trading in your DAI for BREAD, your DAI is lent out on Aave in which the interest accumulated is able to go directly to help fund Breadchain. The interest you yield from Aave is based on the amount of borrowing being done by traders who pay a certain interest percentage on the loan. A portion of that interest is then given to those who are lending.
- What is the price of BREAD?
  - 1 DAI is always equal to 1 BREAD and vice-versa. The BREAD token is not speculative and is always worth 1 DAI which is always worth roughly $1 USD.
- What if I want to get my DAI back?
  - That’s totally fine! You can always burn your BREAD to receive the equivalent amount of DAI back. Remember that 1 DAI is always equal to 1 BREAD by using this application.
- Where does the BREAD go when it’s burned?
  - It disappears! This way, the only amount of BREAD that can be existence is the exact amount of DAI that is been given to the smart contract. All BREAD is therefore backed 1:1 by DAI and there is no fractional reserve. This means there is no risk that when you want to burn your BREAD that there will be not be enough DAI left.
- What can I do with BREAD?
  - BREAD is essentially a wrapped version of DAI and is always backed by an equivalent amount of DAI so you can use BREAD similarly as you would DAI except by using BREAD, you are expressing your support for the cooperative economy. In the Crypto Leftist discord community, as a BREAD holder you get access to an extra channel only accessible to holders of BREAD.
  You can also help add liquidity in our managed [Arrakis liquidity pool](https://beta.arrakis.finance/#/vaults/0x3055C602454ddE1BDa3e98B1bCfD2Ed68ab9789E) on Uniswap V3 which anyone can provide DAI and BREAD in equal amounts as liquidity, but only at a price range at a fraction of penny below and above $1. Providing liquidity through this pool helps protect the BREAD token from speculators.
  As the Breadchain Network grows, we plan on having more benefits to holding or transacting with BREAD. If you’re interested in partnering up to explore uses of BREAD with your own project, please reach out at breadchaincoop@gmail.com. We are especially interested in attempts to use BREAD as a reserve asset for helping cooperative blockchain projects.
- Is this stablecoin risky like what happened with LUNA / UST?
  - The difference with UST is that DAI, which backs BREAD, is an over-collateralized stablecoin that runs on MakerDAO whereas UST was an algorithmic stablecoin with very little collateralization. Of course there is always a risk in anything financial, but the basics of BREAD token solvency relies ultimately on 2 things:

  - Solvency of DAI
  - Solvency of the Aave protocol
  Given those two assumptions, BREAD is solvent.
