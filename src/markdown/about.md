The Breadchain Crowdstaking Application is a smart contract on the Polygon network that forwards Crowdstakersâ€™ DAI (a fully collateralized US Dollar pegged stablecoin) into a lending pool in which all of the interest earned on the DAI goes to Breadchain to help fund more projects part of the [Breadchain Network](https://breadcha.in/projects).

In return for giving DAI, Crowdstakers mint and receive a token called BREAD as collateral in the same quantity they gave in DAI. The BREAD token acts as both a form of collateral from the cooperative and a digital local currency for the Breadchain Network of projects and broader ecosystem. Digital as in crypto and local not as in geographic locality, but local in shared values around cooperativism. And like a local currency, it is intended to keep value within the defined locality. It is at the same time an engine for fundraising for post-capitalist blockchain projects as well as a digital local currency mechanism. It is the first solidarity primitive created by the Breadchain Cooperative.
