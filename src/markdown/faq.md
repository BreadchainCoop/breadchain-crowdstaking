### What is Breadchain?

Breadchain is a collective federation of decentralized cooperative projects looking to forge solidarity through tech projects that help us build a truly cooperative, democratic economy. You can read more about us [here](https://breadchain.mirror.xyz/).

### What do I need to get some BREAD?

You need to have an Ethereum wallet that can connect to Polygon through one of the methods listed on the app page, the amount of DAI you want to bake into BREAD, and some MATIC cryptocurrency to pay for the transaction fee for the Polygon Network.

### How do I get DAI and MATIC on the Polygon network?

First make sure that your wallet can connect to Polygon. [Here](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/metamask/config-polygon-on-metamask/) are the instructions for doing so on Metamask but the same can be applied for many others. There are then several options for getting DAI and MATIC to your wallet on the Polygon network.

**Option 1** - Directly from a Centralized Exchange

Exchanges like Coinbase, Crypto.com, and Binance offer withdrawals directly on to Polygon.

**Option 2** - Transak / Moonpay
With [Transak](https://transak.com/) you can buy crypto with a debit or credit card including MATIC to send to a polygon wallet. [Moonpay](https://www.moonpay.com/buy/matic) is another option for those in the US. You may need to go through KYC.

**Option 3** - [Polygon Bridge](https://wallet.polygon.technology/polygon/bridge/deposit)
The official Polygon bridge can be used by those who already have assets on the ethereum main chain but there will potentially be a significant gas cost.

**Option 4** - [Hop Exchange](https://hop.exchange/)
Hop Exchange allows asset bridging across several Ethereum layer 2s and Polygon so that you don’t have to pay mainnet transaction fees.

### Why use Polygon and not another network?

When we first detailed the application we had the intention of deploying it on the Ethereum main net but we realized that the gas fees were much too high to justify whereas using the app on Polygon consistently costs below $0.03 or even below $0.01 to interact with. We understand that deploying on Polygon is less decentralized than the Ethereum main net, but for the beginning we think this is the right approach. In the future we’d like to consider moving to a proper Ethereum Layer 2 solution but we are waiting to see the ecosystem mature before migrating. At the same time, Polygon usually yields a good APY as it has a thriving DeFi ecosystem for the moment.

### How does me minting BREAD, help the cooperative economy on the blockchain?

By trading in your DAI for BREAD, your DAI is lent out on Aave in which the interest accumulated is able to go directly to help fund Breadchain. The interest you yield from Aave is based on the amount of borrowing being done by traders who may a certain interest percentage on the loan. A portion of that interest is then given to those who are lending.

### What is the price of BREAD?

1 DAI is always equal to 1 BREAD and vice-versa. The BREAD token is not speculative and is always worth 1 DAI which is always worth roughly $1 USD.

### What if I want to get my DAI back?

That’s totally fine! You can always burn your BREAD to receive the equivalent amount of DAI back. Remember that 1 DAI is always equal to 1 BREAD by using this application.

### Where does the BREAD go when it’s burned?

It disappears! This way, the only amount of BREAD that can be existence is the exact amount of DAI that is been given to the smart contract. All BREAD is therefore backed 1:1 by DAI and there is no fractional reserve. This means there is no risk that when you want to burn your BREAD that there will be not be enough DAI left.

### What can I do with BREAD?

BREAD is essentially a wrapped version of DAI and is always backed by an equivalent amount of DAI so you can use BREAD similarly as you would DAI except by using BREAD, you are expressing your support for the cooperative economy. In the Crypto Leftist discord community, as a BREAD holder you get access to an extra channel only accessible to holders of BREAD. As the Breadchain Network grows, we plan on having more benefits to holding or transacting with BREAD. 

Listeners of [The Blockchain Socialist](https://theblockchainsocialist.com/) podcast can become members of the TBS DAO by purchasing the TBS NFT monthly subscription in BREAD which gives them access to being able to vote on what happens to a portion of the revenues collected.

If you’re interested in partnering up to explore uses of BREAD with your own project, please reach out at breadchaincoop@gmail.com. We are especially interested in attempts to use BREAD as a reserve asset for helping cooperative blockchain projects.

### Is this stablecoin risky like what happened with LUNA / UST?

The difference with UST is that DAI, which backs BREAD, is an over-collateralized stablecoin that runs on MakerDAO whereas UST was an algorithmic stablecoin with very little or no collateralization. Of course there is always a risk in this space, but the basics of BREAD token solvency relies ultimately on 3 things:

- Solvency of DAI
- Solvency of the Aave protocol
- No unforeseen smart contract bugs

Given those three assumptions, BREAD is solvent.
