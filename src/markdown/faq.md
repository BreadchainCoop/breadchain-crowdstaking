### What is Breadchain?

Breadchain is a collective federation of decentralized cooperative projects looking to advance a progressive vision for blockchain and its effect on society. We aim to do this by building and utilizing what we call “solidarity primitives.” You can read more about us [here](https://breadchain.mirror.xyz/).

### What do I need to get some BREAD?

All you need is an Ethereum wallet, the DAI you want to bake into BREAD, and some MATIC to pay for the cheap transaction fees on the Polygon Network! 

### How do I get DAI and MATIC on the Polygon network?

First make sure that your Ethereum wallet can connect to Polygon. [Here](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/metamask/config-polygon-on-metamask/) are the instructions for doing so with Metamask -  the same methods can be used with many other popular wallets. After your wallet is connected to Polygon, there are then several ways to get some DAI and MATIC into your wallet.

**Option 1** - Directly from a Centralized Exchange
Exchanges like Coinbase, Crypto.com, and Binance offer withdrawals directly into Polygon.

**Option 2** - Transak / Moonpay
With [Transak](https://transak.com/) you can buy crypto with a debit or credit card including MATIC to send to a polygon wallet. [Moonpay](https://www.moonpay.com/buy/matic) is another option for those in the US. You may need to go through KYC.

[Moonpay](https://www.moonpay.com/buy/matic) is another option for those living in the US. KYC, or, “Know-Your-Customer”, legal requirements may apply here.

**Option 3** - [Polygon Bridge](https://wallet.polygon.technology/polygon/bridge/deposit)
The official Polygon Bridge can be used by those who already have assets on Ethereum Mainnet, but there will potentially be a significant gas cost incurred when using this method.

**Option 4** - [Hop Exchange](https://hop.exchange/)
Hop Exchange allows asset bridging across several Ethereum Layer 2 networks, including Polygon, so that you don’t have to pay for potentially high Ethereum Mainnet transaction fees.

### Why use Polygon and not another network?

Instead of paying for the frequently high gas fees present on Ethereum Mainnet, using the Crowdstaking Application on Polygon instead consistently costs cents in fees with every transaction. We understand that as it stands, Polygon is less decentralized than Ethereum Mainnet. We are currently watching the ecosystem mature, however, in the future we may consider moving the Crowdstaking Application to a true Ethereum Layer 2 solution when the time is right. For now, Polygon has cultivated a thriving DeFI ecosystem and, as a result, offers a dependable APY that suits our current needs.

### How do I help the cooperative economy on the blockchain by minting BREAD?

When swapping your DAI for BREAD, your DAI gets automatically sent to an interest bearing AAVE lending pool. 100% of the interest earned on this DAI is then automatically sent back to Breadchain in order to help fund itself and the projects that exist within the Breadchain Network.  As such, the Crowdstaking Application functions as an engine for fundraising.

### What is the price of BREAD?

1 DAI (worth roughly $1 USD) is always equal to 1 BREAD and vice-versa. The BREAD token is not speculative and is always worth 1 DAI. 

### What if I want to get my DAI back?

That’s totally fine! Any time you like, you can burn your BREAD and, in doing so, receive the equivalent amount of DAI back. Remember that 1 DAI is always equal to 1 BREAD when using this application.

### Where does the BREAD go when it’s burned?

It gets destroyed! This way, the total amount of BREAD in existence can only ever be the exact amount of DAI that has been given to the smart contract. All BREAD is therefore backed 1:1 by DAI with no fractional reserve in use. This means burning BREAD is a risk free action - there will always be DAI available for you to reclaim.

### What can I do with BREAD?

BREAD is essentially a wrapped version of DAI and, as such, can be used in the same ways you would normally use DAI. When using BREAD, you are expressing your support for the cooperative economy. As a BREAD holder, members of the Crypto Leftist discord channel  are given access to an extra token gated channel. As the Breadchain Network grows, we plan on offering more benefits to those who hold or transact with BREAD.

If you’re interested in partnering up in order to explore how you can use BREAD within your own project, please reach out to us at contact@breadchain.xyz. We are especially interested in attempts to use BREAD as a reserve asset for helping cooperative blockchain projects.

### Is BREAD risky to use? (Like what happened with LUNA / UST?)

DAI, which backs BREAD, is an over-collateralized stablecoin that runs on MakerDAO, whereas UST was an algorithmic stablecoin backed by very little or no collateral. Over-collateralized stablecoins offer a greater amount of safety and security compared to algorithmic stablecoins.
