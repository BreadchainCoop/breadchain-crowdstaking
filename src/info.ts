export default `So how does the Breadchain Crowdstaking Protocol work?

The protocol is essentially a smart contract on ethereum that forwards Crowdstakers’ DAI (a US Dollar pegged stablecoin) into a lending pool in which all of the interest earned on the DAI goes to the Breadchain multi-signature wallet which is controlled by Breadchain Cooperative members to help fund more projects part of the [Breadchain Network](https://breadcha.in/projects). 

In return for giving DAI, Crowdstakers mint and receive a token called BREAD as collateral in the same quantity they gave in DAI. The BREAD token acts as both a form of collateral from the cooperative and a digital local currency for the Breadchain Network of projects and broader ecosystem.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the Breadchain Crowdstaking Protocol?

It is at the same time an engine for fundraising for post-capitalist blockchain projects as well as a digital local currency mechanism. It is the first solidarity primitive created by the Breadchain Cooperative.

### What is Breadchain?

Breadchain is a collective federation of decentralized cooperative projects looking to forge solidarity through tech projects that help us build a truly cooperative, democratic economy. You can read more about us [here](https://breadcha.in/blog/2).

### What do I need to get some BREAD?

You need to have the Metamask browser plugin, the amount of DAI to mint into BREAD, and some ether cryptocurrency to pay for the transaction fee in your Metamask wallet.

### How does me minting BREAD, help the cooperative economy on the blockchain?

By trading in your DAI for BREAD, your DAI is lent out on Compound in which the interest accumulated is able to go directly to help fund Breadchain.

### What is the price of BREAD?

1 DAI is always equal to 1 BREAD and vice-versa. The BREAD token is not speculative and is always worth 1 DAI which is always worth roughly $1 USD. There may be a slightly different price on decentralized exchanges, but

### What if I want to get my DAI back?

That’s totally fine! You can always burn your BREAD to receive the equivalent amount of DAI back. Remember that 1 DAI is always equal to 1 BREAD by using this application.

### Where does the BREAD go when it’s burned?

It disappears! This way, the only amount of BREAD that can be existence is the exact amount of DAI that is been given to the smart contract. All BREAD is therefore backed 1:1 by DAI and there is no fractional reserve. This means there is no risk that when you want to burn your BREAD that there will be not enough DAI left.

### What if I don’t have DAI and still want BREAD?

In order to use this application, you need to have DAI to mint BREAD. However one alternative is to use Uniswap V3 on the ethereum mainnet to exchange any cryptocurrency you might have for BREAD.

### What if I don’t want to pay so much in transaction fees?

At the moment, this is the only place where BREAD can be minted reliably but over time we plan to add liquidity of BREAD to different decentralized exchanges on other chains with lower transaction fees.

**ONCE LIQUIDITY ADDED:** The main alternative to minting BREAD from this application is using a decentralized exchange on a Layer 2 or sidechain of ethereum. At the moment you will find liquidity on these exchanges

### What can I do with BREAD?

BREAD is essentially a wrapped version of DAI and is always backed by an equivalent amount of DAI so you can use BREAD similarly as you would DAI except by using BREAD, you are expressing your support for the cooperative economy. 

In the Crypto Leftist discord community, as a BREAD holder you get access to an extra channel only accessible to holders of BREAD. As the Breadchain Network grows, we plan on having more benefits to holding or transacting with BREAD.

If you’re interested in partnering up to explore uses of BREAD with your own project, please reach out at breadchaincoop@gmail.com.

### What if a bad actor tries to take advantage of the price on crypto markets?

If a bad actor tries to pump or dump the price of BREAD compared to DAI on cryptocurrency markets, Breadchain can take advantage of the situation through arbitrage between the crowdstaking protocol contract and the exchange in either direction. The earnings of the arbitrage instigated by bad actors can then be turned into more funding for Breadchain.

It’s a win no matter what!`;
