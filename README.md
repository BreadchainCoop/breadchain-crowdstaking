## Test In Browser

To mint BREAD on the rinkeby testnet you'll need some test ETH for gas as well as some DAI

First get some test ETH at a [rinkeby faucet](https://www.rinkebyfaucet.com/)

Head over to the [compound](https://app.compound.finance/) app to get some DAI. Make sure your wallet is connected to the rinkeby network and select DAI under supply markets.

Click **faucet** at the bottom to request some test DAI.
